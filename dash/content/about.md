## Welcome to Peptide Digest!

We are a team of UC Berkeley students in the Master of Molecular Science and Software Engineering (MSSE) program working with Merck to develop a tool that provides efficient summaries of scientific publications! Our goal is to help Merck researchers stay updated with the latest computational peptide research.

Our team members include: Joshua Blomgren, Elizabeth Gilson, and Jeffrey Jacob.

We are advised by Dr. Jennifer Johnston, Dr. Gregory Bryman, Dr. Tianchi Chen, and Dr. Wendong Ge from Merck and by Dr. Jessica Nash from MSSE.
